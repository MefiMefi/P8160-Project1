## Design of simulation settings
We conducted simulation studies to assess the performance of three survival models. In total, we created 7 simulation settings by mixing the event time generated from the three specified baseline hazard function: exponential, Weibull, and Gompertz hazard function. Then the generated data were fitted to exponential, Weibull, and Cox proportional hazard models. The parameters we applied in the models are constants: $\alpha = 0.5$, $\gamma = 1.5$, $\beta = -0.5$. Since the shape of Weibull distribution has great difference between $\gamma > 1$ and $\gamma < 1$, thus we simulated in scenarios where  $\gamma = 0.5$ and $\gamma = 1.5$, 

We simulated 500 data sets in each simulation setting. After running the models, a set of $\beta$ was extracted and used to calculate the mean absolute errors, variance, and squared error. To evaluate the efficiency performances of models, we simulated data of different sample sizes: 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 200, 400. Similarly, absolute errors, variance, MSE are calculated. 

All the simulation processes were performed in R.

## Methods for generating data
The survival dataset contains treatment assignment, status indicator, and observed time. Treatment assignment variable $X_i$ is generated from a Bernoulli distribution with p = 0.5. By utilizing the inverse transformation method, we can obtain event time T: 

$T=H_{0}^{-1}\left(\frac{-\log (u)}{e^{x^{T} \beta}}\right)$, where $U \sim U(0,1)$

The followings are specific baseline hazard functions we applied:\

1. Survival time under Exponential distribution:
$T=-\frac{\log (u)}{\lambda e^{x^{T} \beta}}$

2. Survival time under Weibull distribution:
$T=\left(-\frac{\log (u)}{\lambda e^{x^{T} \beta}}\right)^{\frac{1}{\gamma}}$

3. Survival time under Gompertz distribution:
$T=\frac{1}{\alpha} \log \left(1-\frac{\alpha \log (u)}{\lambda e^{x^{T} \beta}}\right)$

We simulated survival data by the event time generated from the mixtures of three baseline distributions. 

Mixture of Exponential and Weibull distribution:
$$T=p *(-\frac{\log (u)}{\lambda e^{x^{T} \beta}}) + (1-p)*(-\frac{\log (u)}{\lambda e^{x^{T} \beta}})^{1 / \gamma}$$ 
We take values of p as 0, 0.5 and 1. When `p = 1`, event time is generated from exponential baseline; when `p = 0`, event time is generated from Weibull distribution. 

Mixture of Exponential and Gompertz distribution:
$$T=p *(-\frac{\log (u)}{\lambda e^{x^{T} \beta}}) + (1-p)*(\frac{1}{\alpha} \log \left(1-\frac{\alpha \log (u)}{\lambda e^{x^{T} \beta}}\right))$$
Similary, we take values of p as 0, 0.5 and 1. When `p = 1`, event time is generated from exponential baseline; when `p = 0`, event time is generated from Gompertz distribution. Finally, make event indicator variable by applying administrative censoring at t = 5.

By repeating each of the above simulation process 500 times, we get survival datasets with sample size ranging from 20 to 400.
